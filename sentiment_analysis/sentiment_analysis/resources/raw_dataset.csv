2041,I wasn't the least bit interested.  ,negative
2042,"Not only did it only confirm that the film would be unfunny and generic, but it also managed to give away the ENTIRE movie; and I'm not exaggerating - every moment, every plot point, every joke is told in the trailer.  ",negative
2043,But it's just not funny.  ,negative
2044,But even the talented Carrell can't save this.  ,negative
2045,"His co-stars don't fare much better, with people like Morgan Freeman, Jonah Hill, and Ed Helms just wasted.  ",negative
2046,The story itself is just predictable and lazy.  ,negative
2047,"The only real effects work is the presence of all the animals, and the integration of those into the scenes is some of the worst and most obvious blue/green-screen work I've ever seen.  ",negative

2066,There is a totally unnecessary train/roller coaster scene.  ,negative
2067,There was absolutely no warmth or charm to these scenes or characters.  ,negative
2068,This movie totally grates on my nerves.  ,negative
2069,"The performances are not improved by improvisation, because the actors now have twice as much to worry about: not only whether they're delivering the line well, but whether the line itself is any good.  ",negative
2070,"And, quite honestly, often its not very good.  ",negative
2071,"Often the dialogue doesn't really follow from one line to another, or fit the surroundings.  ",negative

2075,"The suspense builders were good, & just cross the line from G to PG.  ",positive

2092,It was horrendous.  ,negative
2093,There was NOTHING believable about it at all.  ,negative
2094,The only suspense I was feeling was the frustration at just how retarded the girls were.  ,negative
2095,MANNA FROM HEAVEN is a terrific film that is both predictable and unpredictable at the same time.  ,positive
2096,The scenes are often funny and occasionally touching as the characters evaluate their lives and where they are going.  ,positive
2097,The cast of veteran actors are more than just a nostalgia trip.  ,positive
2098,Ursula Burton's portrayal of the nun is both touching and funny at the same time with out making fun of nuns or the church.  ,positive
2099,"If you are looking for a movie with a terrific cast, some good music(including a Shirley Jones rendition of ""The Way You Look Tonight""), and an uplifting ending, give this one a try.  ",positive

2111,The directing and the cinematography aren't quite as good.  ,negative
2112,"The movie was so boring, that I sometimes found myself occupied peaking in the paper instead of watching (never happened during a Columbo movie before!  ",negative
2113,"), and sometimes it was so embarrassing that I had to look away.  ",negative
2114,The directing seems too pretentious.  ,negative
2115,"The scenes with the ""oh-so-mature"" neighbour-girl are a misplace.  ",negative
2116,And generally the lines and plot is weaker than the average episode.  ,negative
2117,"Then scene where they debated whether or not to sack the trumpeter (who falsely was accused for the murder) is pure horror, really stupid.  ",negative

2119,I really liked that.  ,positive
2120,A great film by a great director.  ,positive

2124,Brilliant!  ,positive
2125,10/10  ,positive
2126,I liked this movie way too much.  ,positive
2127,My only problem is I thought the actor playing the villain was a low rent Michael Ironside.  ,negative
2128,It rocked my world and is certainly a must see for anyone with no social or physical outlets.  ,positive
2129,"However, this didn't make up for the fact that overall, this was a tremendously boring movie.  ",negative
2130,"There was NO chemistry between Ben Affleck and Sandra Bullock in this film, and I couldn't understand why he would consider even leaving his wife-to-be for this chick that he supposedly was knocked out by.  ",negative
2131,There were several moments in the movie that just didn't need to be there and were excruciatingly slow moving.  ,negative

2135,I could not stand to even watch it for very long for fear of losing I.Q.  ,negative
2136,I guess that nobody at the network that aired this dribble watched it before putting it on.  ,negative

2138,"I saw ""Mirrormask"" last night and it was an unsatisfactory experience.  ",negative
2139,"Unfortunately, inexperience of direction meant that scene after scene passed with little in the way of dramatic tension or conflict.  ",negative
2140,"These are the central themes of the film and they are handled ineptly, stereotypically and with no depth of imagination.  ",negative
2141,All the pretty pictures in the world cannot make up for a piece of work that is flawed at the core.  ,negative
2142,"It is an hour and half waste of time, following a bunch of very pretty high schoolers whine and cry about life.  ",negative
2143,"You can't relate with them, hell you barely can understand them.  ",negative

2149,The only possible way this movie could be redeemed would be as MST3K fodder.  ,negative

2162,Awful.  ,negative
2163,I don't think I've ever gone to a movie and disliked it as much.  ,negative
2164,It was a good thing that the tickets only cost five dollars because I would be mad if I'd have paid $7.50 to see this crap.  ,negative
2165,NOBODY identifies with these characters because they're all cardboard cutouts and stereotypes (or predictably reverse-stereotypes).  ,negative
2166,"This is a bad film, with bad writing, and good actors....an ugly cartoon crafted by Paul Haggis for people who can't handle anything but the bold strokes in storytelling....a picture painted with crayons.  ",negative
2167,"Crash is a depressing little nothing, that provokes emotion, but teaches you nothing if you already know racism and prejudice are bad things.  ",negative
2168,"Still, I do like this movie for it's empowerment of women; there's not enough movies out there like this one.  ",positive
2169,Your brain will attempt to shut-down as part of a primal impulse of self-preservation.  ,negative
2170,I was left shattered from the experience of watching this 'film' and I took a good two hours to fully recover.  ,negative
2171,This movie now joins Revenge of the Boogeyman and Zombiez as part of the hellish trinity of horror films.  ,negative
2172,I certainly do not mean this distinction in a good way.  ,negative
2173,I mean this in a terrible way.  ,negative
2174,This film has no redeeming features.  ,negative
2175,Everything is appalling.  ,negative

2178,The script iswas there a script?  ,negative
2179,The kids are annoying.  ,negative
2180,The lead man is charisma-free.  ,negative
2181,"Utterly without merit on any level, this is akin to torture.  ",negative
2182,I'll even say it again  this is torture.  ,negative
2183,Maybe there would be a reasonable explanation for this atrocity.  ,negative
2184,Not a pleasant voyage of self-discovery.  ,negative
2185,Highly unrecommended.  ,negative
2186,"If this premise sound stupid, that's because it is.  ",negative
2187,"Yes, it's that bad.  ",negative
2188,Nothing at all to recommend.  ,negative

2190,"Garbo, who showed right off the bat that her talents could carry over from the silent era (I wanted to see some of her silent work, but Netflix doesn't seem to be stocking them.  ",positive
2191,It's also great to see that renowned silent screenwriter Frances Marion hasn't missed a step going from silent to sound.  ,positive
2192,"This movie suffered because of the writing, it needed more suspense.  ",negative
2193,There were too many close ups.  ,negative
2194,But other than that the movie seemed to drag and the heroes didn't really work for their freedom.  ,negative
2195,But this movie is definitely a below average rent.  ,negative
2196,"""You'll love it!  ",positive
2197,This movie is BAD.  ,negative
2198,So bad.  ,negative
2199,The film is way too long.  ,negative
2200,This is definitely one of the bad ones.  ,negative
2201,The movie I received was a great quality film for it's age.  ,positive
2202,John Wayne did an incredible job for being so young in the movie industry.  ,positive
2203,His on screen presence shined thought even though there were other senior actors on the screen with him.  ,positive
2204,I think that it is a must see older John Wayne film.  ,positive
2205,I really don't see how anyone could enjoy this movie.  ,negative
2206,I don't think I've ever seen a movie half as boring as this self-indulgent piece of junk.  ,negative
2207,"It probably would have been better if the director hadn't spent most of the movie showcasing his own art work, which really isn't that noteworthy.  ",negative
2208,"Another thing I didn't really like is when a character got punched in the face, a gallon of blood would spew forth soon after.  ",negative
2209,Jamie Foxx absolutely IS Ray Charles.  ,positive
2210,His performance is simply genius.  ,positive
2211,"He owns the film, just as Spacek owned ""Coal Miner's Daughter"" and Quaid owned ""Great Balls of Fire.  ",positive
2212,""" In fact, it's hard to remember that the part of Ray Charles is being acted, and not played by the man himself.  ",positive
2213,Ray Charles is legendary.  ,positive
2214,"Ray Charles' life provided excellent biographical material for the film, which goes well beyond being just another movie about a musician.  ",positive
2215,Hitchcock is a great director.  ,positive
2216,Ironically I mostly find his films a total waste of time to watch.  ,negative
2217,"Secondly, Hitchcock pretty much perfected the thriller and chase movie.  ",positive

2620,"This is a masterful piece of film-making, with many themes simmering and occasionally boiling over in this warts and all study of the poet's bohemian, self-indulgent wartime years that span the aerial bombardments of London and the outward tranquillity of a Welsh coastal retreat - the borderlines between friendship, lust and love, dedication to art and experience versus practical concerns, jealousy, rivalry, cowardice and egotism versus heroism and self-sacrifice and more.

2621,"A mature, subtle script that suggests and occasionally brings into dramatic focus the underlying tensions is well served by perfect performances (apart from the odd inappropriate smiling that Keira Knightley is prone to, though perhaps under direction this time as the other characters themselves often mention it).

2635,"Lovely little thriller from Hitchcock, with lots of nice shenanigans surrounding a murdered spy, a kidnapped child, a nasty church, a foreign plot and some random taxidermists.  ",positive
2636,"Jimmy Stewart is as ever a great hero for Hitchcock, the story rips along to its cool climax at an embassy function, but it lacks the brooding menace of Hitchcock's black and white, low-budget original.  ",positive
