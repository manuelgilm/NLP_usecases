## 🧐 About <a name = "about"></a>

Sentiment Analysis is the process of determining the sentiment of a given text. It is a form of text analysis that involves classifying texts into a pre-defined sentiment. The sentiment can be positive, negative.

The goal of this project is to build a sentiment analysis model that can be used to classify the sentiment of a given text. The model will be trained on a dataset of text data that has been labeled with a sentiment. The model will then be used to classify the sentiment of new text data.

The project is meant to be a learning experience. I will be using this project to learn about the different techniques and algorithms that are used in sentiment analysis and the best MLops practices. I will also be using this project to learn about the different tools and libraries that are used in sentiment analysis.

## 🏁 Getting Started <a name = "getting_started"></a>

These instructions will get you a copy of the project up and running on your local machine for development and testing purposes. See [deployment](#deployment) for notes on how to deploy the project on a live system.

### Prerequisites

What things you need to install the software and how to install them.

```
Give examples
```

### Installing

A step by step series of examples that tell you how to get a development env running.

Say what the step will be

```
Give the example
```

And repeat

```
until finished
```

End with an example of getting some data out of the system or using it for a little demo.

## 🔧 Running the tests <a name = "tests"></a>

Explain how to run the automated tests for this system.

### Break down into end to end tests

Explain what these tests test and why

```
Give an example
```

### And coding style tests

Explain what these tests test and why

```
Give an example
```

## 🎈 Usage <a name="usage"></a>

Add notes about how to use the system.

## 🚀 Deployment <a name = "deployment"></a>
