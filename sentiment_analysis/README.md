## About <a name = "about"></a>

Sentiment Analysis is the process of determining the sentiment of a given text. It is a form of text analysis that involves classifying texts into a pre-defined sentiment. The sentiment can be positive, negative.

The goal of this project is to build a sentiment analysis model that can be used to classify the sentiment of a given text. The model will be trained on a dataset of text data that has been labeled with a sentiment. The model will then be used to classify the sentiment of new text data.

The project is meant to be a learning experience. I will be using this project to learn about the different techniques and algorithms that are used in sentiment analysis and the best MLops practices. I will also be using this project to learn about the different tools and libraries that are used in sentiment analysis.

## 🏁 Getting Started <a name = "getting_started"></a>
