## About <a name = "about"></a>

Sentiment Analysis is the process of determining the sentiment of a given text. It is a form of text analysis that involves classifying texts into a pre-defined sentiment. The sentiment can be positive, or negative.

The goal of this project is to build a sentiment analysis model that can be used to classify the sentiment of a given text. The model will be trained on a dataset of text data that has been labeled with a sentiment. The model will then be used to classify the sentiment of new text data.

The project is meant to be a learning experience. I will be using this project to learn about the different techniques and algorithms that are used in sentiment analysis and the best MLops practices. I will also be using this project to learn about the different tools and libraries that are used in sentiment analysis.

An article about the project can be found [here](https://medium.com/python-in-plain-english/movie-review-text-classification-using-scikit-learn-d72cd375a7d7).

## Getting Started <a name = "getting_started"></a>

These instructions will get you a copy of the project up and running on your local machine for development and testing purposes. See [deployment](#deployment) for notes on how to deploy the project on a live system.

### Prerequisites

* Poetry - Dependency Management
* Python - Programming Language

### Installing

To run this code on your local machine, you will need to have Python and Poetry installed. You can install Python from the official website and Poetry from the official website.

steps: 

1. Clone the repository
2. Install the dependencies
3. Run the code

```bash
cd NLP_usecases/sentiment_analysis
```

```bash
git clone <repo-url>
```

```bash
